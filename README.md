Hi Sneha,

Here are the details of your new repository.

Steps to add this to Xcode:

Github Repository  :   https://github.com/sskolla/100AProjects.git 



Github UserName    :   sskolla



Github Password    :   Secret... you have to remember this. I will tell you 

Always add new folder/directory to project and maintain the programs you are going to code.

Remember, I love you.


Love you,
Suman
